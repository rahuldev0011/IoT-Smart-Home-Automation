# IoT-Smart-Home-Automation
This project demonstrates a simple IoT-based Smart Home Automation System that allows users to control household appliances (like lights or fans) remotely using Wi-Fi. The system uses the NodeMCU (ESP8266) microcontroller to host a web server, enabling users to switch devices ON or OFF via a web interface accessible from any smartphone or laptop .
