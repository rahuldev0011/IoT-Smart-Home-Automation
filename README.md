# 🏠 IoT Smart Home Automation

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **IoT-based Smart Home Automation System** that allows users to control household appliances (like lights or fans) remotely using Wi-Fi.  
The system uses the **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** microcontroller to host a web server, enabling users to switch devices ON or OFF via a web interface accessible from any smartphone or laptop connected to the same network.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- 🔌 Control multiple home appliances wirelessly using Wi-Fi.  
- 🌐 Built-in web server hosted on NodeMCU (no external app required).  
- ⚡ Low-cost and power-efficient system design.  
- 🧠 Demonstrates real-world IoT implementation and automation concepts.  

## 🧰 Components Used
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)  
- 2-Channel Relay Module  
- LED Bulbs / Fans (as loads)  
- Jumper Wires  
- Breadboard  
- Power Supply (5V)  

## 💻 Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE  
- C / Embedded C Programming  
- Web Server using HTML  
- Local Wi-Fi Network  

## 🔍 Working Principle
1. NodeMCU connects to the local Wi-Fi network.  
2. A small web page is hosted on the NodeMCU, displaying buttons for ON/OFF control.  
3. When the user clicks a button on the webpage, NodeMCU receives an HTTP request.  
4. NodeMCU activates or deactivates the connected relay, turning the appliance ON or OFF.  

## 🧩 Applications
- Home and Office automation  
- Energy-saving systems  
- Remote control for disabled or elderly users  
- Prototype for smart city applications  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add **Google Assistant / Alexa** voice control  
- Integrate with **cloud database** (Firebase / Blynk) for remote access  
- Include **temperature or motion sensors** for automatic operation
